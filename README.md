Contributions are welcome

Using
apngdis.exe - APNG Disassembler

img2webp.exe - Google Webp library(libwebp)
https://chromium.googlesource.com/webm/libwebp/

PS: This was a quick solution. And not intended to be performance efficient.
It was only tested on Git-Bash on a Win10 64bit machine.
There is scope to make it work with linux by making minor modifications 
-change to linux dependecies and change file names in .bash files.
And to add options to adjust quality and other parameters. 

Feel free to contribute :)
